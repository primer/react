# @primer/styled-react

> A temporary package that bridges the gap between Primer React and styled-components

## Getting started

To install `@primer/styled-react` in your project, you will need to run the following
command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @primer/styled-react
```

## Usage

This is an interim package designed to make it easy to interop between Primer
and existing styled-components usage. Over time, this component will stop
receiving updates.

Each component that is imported from `@primer/styled-react` is a wrapper around
the corresponding component in `@primer/react`. The notable difference is that
these components support the `sx` prop and styled system props.

By default, each component is deprecated. The intent is to transition code over
to an alternative styling solution, such as CSS Modules.
