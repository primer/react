## Context

Components might be more grokable if they were structured consistently. This ADR proposes conventions

## Decision

TL;DR:

```
primer-react/
â”œâ”€ src/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Breadcrumbs/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.ts                    // Just re-exporting?
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ Breadcrumbs.tsx             // Primary component
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ BreadcrumbsItem.tsx         // Subcomponent (include parent component name to increase findability in most IDEs)
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ Breadcrumbs.mdx             // Documentation. Always .mdx, not .md
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ Breadcrumbs.stories.tsx
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ Breadcrumbs.test.tsx        // Unit tests
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ Breadcrumbs.types.test.tsx  // Type tests
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ Breadcrumbs.yml             // Component metadata (Possible future)
â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ __snapshots__/
â”†  â”†
```

### Rules

- Every component should have its own PascalCased directory directly under `src/`
- Subcomponents should be properties of the exported parent component (e.g., `Breadcrumbs.Item`)
- Replacements of existing components should use an incrementing number (e.g., `Breadcrumbs2` rather than `NewBreadcrumbs`)

## Implementation

- [ ] Migrate components into this structure (as part of [Storybook refactor work](https://github.com/github/primer/issues/1488))
- [ ] Set up tests for the component structure
- [ ] Mark this ADR as adopted
