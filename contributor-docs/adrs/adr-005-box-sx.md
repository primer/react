## Context

In Primer React and consuming applications, we use many different patterns for creating React components. Two common patterns are:

1. Creating components with styled-components

   ```tsx
   const Avatar = styled.img.attrs<StyledAvatarProps>(props => ({
     height: props.size,
     width: props.size,
   }))<StyledAvatarProps>`
     display: inline-block;
     overflow: hidden;
     line-height: ${get('lineHeights.condensedUltra')};
     border-radius: ${props => getBorderRadius(props)};
     ${sx}
   `
   ```

2. Creating components with Box

   ```tsx
   const Avatar: React.FC<AvatarProps> = ({size = 20, alt = '', square = false, sx = {}, ...props}) => {
     const styles: BetterSystemStyleObject = {
       display: 'inline-block',
       overflow: 'hidden',
       lineHeight: 'condensedUltra',
       borderRadius: getBorderRadius({size, square}),
     }

     return (
       <Box
         as="img"
         alt={alt}
         sx={merge<BetterSystemStyleObject>(styles, sx)} // styles needs to merge with props.sx
         {...props}
       />
     )
   }
   ```

## Decision

Prefer using method #2: Creating components with Box for the following reasons:

- Better authoring experience with Typescript. With Box, we can improve the API and autocomplete for consuming primitives. [See research](https://github.com/github/primer/discussions/755#discussioncomment-2318144)
- The styling library (i.e. styled-components) becomes an implementation detail and can be changed later with minimal breaking changes for consumers. (Avoids leaky abstractions)
- We have had issues with exporting types, we can increase confidence by keeping the exported types close to what we author.
