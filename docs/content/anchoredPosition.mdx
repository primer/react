title: Anchored Position Behavior
---

The `getAnchoredPosition` behavior and `useAnchoredPosition` hook are used to calculate the position of a "floating" element that is anchored to another DOM element. This is useful for implementing overlay UI, such as dialogs, popovers, tooltips, toasts, and dropdown-style menus.

At a high level, the `getAnchoredPosition` routine will attempt to find the most suitable position for the floating element based on the passed-in settings, its containing element, and the size and position of the anchor element. Specifically, the calculated position should try to ensure that the floating element, when positioned at the calculated coordinates, does not overflow or underflow the container's bounding box.

Settings for this routine allow the user to customize several aspects of this calculation. See **PositionSettings** below for a detailed description of these settings.

### Usage

```ts
const settings = {
  side: 'outside-right',
  align: 'center',
  alignmentOffset: 10,
  anchorOffset: -10
} as Partial<PositionSettings>
const float = document.getElementById("floatingElement")
const anchor = document.getElementById("anchorElement")
const {top, left} = getAnchoredPosition(float, anchor, settings)
float.style.top = `${top}px`
float.style.left = `${left}px`
```
### PositionSettings
`PositionSettings` is an object with the following interface
| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| :- | :- | :-: | :- |
| side | AnchorSide | "outside-bottom" | Sets the side of the anchor element that the floating element should be pinned to. This side is given by a string starting with either "inside" or "outside", followed by a hyphen, followed by either "top", "right", "bottom", or "left". Additionally, "inside-center" is an allowed value.

The first part of this string, "inside" or "outside", determines whether the floating element should be attempted to be placed "inside" the anchor element or "outside" of it. Using "inside" is useful for making it appear that the anchor _contains_ the floating element, and it can be used for implementing a dialog that is centered on the screen. The "outside" value is more common and can be used for tooltips, popovers, menus, etc.

The second part of this string determines the _edge_ on the anchor element that the floating element will be anchored to. If side is "inside-center", then the floating element will be centered in the X-direction (while align is used to position it in the Y-direction). |
| align | AnchoredPositionAlign | "first" | Determines how the floating element should align with the anchor element. If set to "first", the floating element's first edge (top or left) will align with the anchor element's first edge. If set to "center", the floating element will be centered along the axis of the anchor edge. If set to "last", the floating element's last edge will align with the anchor element's last edge. |
| anchorOffset | number | 4* | The number of pixels between the anchor edge and the floating element. Positive values move the floating element farther from the anchor element (for outside positioning) or further inside the anchor element (for inside positioning). Negative values have the opposite effect. |
| alignmentOffset | number | 4** | An additional offset, in pixels, to move the floating element from the aligning edge. Positive values move the floating element in the direction of center-alignment. Negative values move the floating element away from center-alignment. When align is "center", positive offsets move the floating element right (top or bottom anchor side) or down (left or right anchor side). |
| preventOverflow | boolean | true | If true, when the above settings result in rendering the floating element wholly or partially off-screen, attempt to adjust the settings to prevent this. Only applies to "outside" positioning.

First, attempt to flip to the opposite edge of the anchor if the floating element is getting clipped in that direction. If flipping results in a similar clipping, try moving to the adjacent sides.

Once we find a side that does not clip the overlay in its own dimension, check the rest of the sides to see if we need to adjust the alignment offset to fit in other dimensions.

If we try all four sides and get clipped each time, settle for overflowing and use the "bottom" side, since the ability to scroll is most likely in this direction. |

\* If `side` is set to `"inside-center"`, this defaults to `0` instead of `4`.
\** If using outside positioning, or if `align` is set to `"center"`, this defaults to `0` instead of `4`.
