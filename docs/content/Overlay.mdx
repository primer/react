```js
import {Overlay} from '@primer/react'
```

The `Overlay` component handles all behaviors needed by overlay UIs as well as the common styles that all overlays should have. `Overlay` is the base component for many of our overlay-type components. Overlays use shadows to express elevation.

**Behaviors include:**

- Rendering the overlay in a React Portal so that it always renders on top of other content on the page
- Trapping focus
- Calling a user provided function when the user presses `Escape`
- Calling a user provided function when the user clicks outside of the container
- Focusing either user provided element, or the first focusable element in the container when it is opened
- Returning focus to an element when container is closed

## Example

```javascript live noinline
const Example = () => {
  // you must manage your own open state
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)
  const noButtonRef = React.useRef(null)
  const anchorRef = React.useRef(null)
  return (
    <>
      <Button ref={anchorRef} onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>
        open overlay
      </Button>
      {/* be sure to conditionally render the Overlay. This helps with performance and is required. */}
      {isOpen && (
        <Overlay
          initialFocusRef={noButtonRef}
          returnFocusRef={anchorRef}
          ignoreClickRefs={[anchorRef]}
          onEscape={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}
          onClickOutside={() => setIsOpen(false)}
          aria-labelledby="title"
        >
          <Box display="flex" flexDirection="column" p={2}>
            <Text id="title">Are you sure you would like to delete this item?</Text>
            <Button>yes</Button>
            <Button ref={noButtonRef}>no</Button>
          </Box>
        </Overlay>
      )}
    </>
  )
}

render(<Example />)
```

## Accessibility considerations

- The `Overlay` must either have:
  - A value set for the `aria-labelledby` attribute that refers to a visible title.
  - An `aria-label` attribute
- If the `Overlay` should also have a longer description, use `aria-describedby`
- The `Overlay` component has a `role="dialog"` set on it, if you are using `Overlay` for alerts, you can pass in `role="alertdialog"` instead. Please read the [W3C guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#alertdialog) to determine which role is best for your use case
- The `Overlay` component has `aria-modal` set to `true` by default and should not be overridden as all `Overlay`s behave as modals.

See the [W3C accessibility recommendations for modals](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#dialog_roles_states_props).

## Positioning

`Overlay` renders its `children` within a div positioned absolutely within a portal within the default portal root. The overlay will not update its positioning if the portal root's positioning changes (e.g., if the portal root is statically positioned after some DOM element that dynamically resizes). You may consider using the [AnchoredOverlay](/AnchoredOverlay) component or [customizing the portal root](/Portal#customizing-the-portal-root) to achieve different positioning behavior.

The position of the Overlay can be customized by using the `position` prop in conjunction with the `top|left|right|bottom` props.
