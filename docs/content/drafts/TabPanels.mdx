import data from '../../../packages/react/src/drafts/TabPanels/TabPanels.docs.json'

```js
import {TabPanels} from '@primer/react/drafts'
```

**Attention:** Make sure to properly label your `TabPanels` with an `aria-label` to provide context about the subject of your `TabPanels`.

`TabPanels.Tab` elements are wired up to their `TabPanels.Panel` elements based on the index order that they exist in the document.

## Examples

```jsx live drafts
<TabPanels aria-label="Select a tab" id="tab-panels" selectedTabIndex={0}>
  <TabPanels.Tab>Tab 1</TabPanels.Tab>
  <TabPanels.Tab>Tab 2</TabPanels.Tab>
  <TabPanels.Tab>Tab 3</TabPanels.Tab>
  <TabPanels.Panel>Panel 1</TabPanels.Panel>
  <TabPanels.Panel>Panel 2</TabPanels.Panel>
  <TabPanels.Panel>Panel 3</TabPanels.Panel>
</TabPanels>
```

## Props

<ComponentProps data={data} />
