# Migration guide

## `4.0.0-beta`

[The 4.0.0-beta release](https://github.com/primer/react/releases/v4.0.0-beta) renames some components:

- `FlexContainer` is now named `Flex`
- `FlexItem` is now `Flex.Item`
- `UnderlineNavItem` is now `UnderlineNav.Item`
- `FilterListItem` is now `FilterList.Item`

There is a [codemod](#codemods) available to upgrade component identifiers from [v3.x.x-beta](#300-beta):

```
npx jscodeshift -t node_modules/@primer/components/codemods/v4.js path/to/src
```

The following breaking changes must be accounted for manually:

- `Label` no longer has a `scheme` prop, but now respects `size` and `dropshadow` props.
- `StateLabel` **does** have a `scheme` prop (instead of `state`), and takes different values.

## `3.0.0-beta`

**:rotating_light: As of v3, the name of the package has changed from `primer-react` to `@primer/components`.**

[The 3.0.0-beta release](https://github.com/primer/react/releases/v3.0.0-beta) contains the following breaking changes:

- The `MergeStatus` component is gone. Use a `StateLabel` instead.
- The `Link` component no longer accepts `scheme` or `muted` props, and has no underline by default.
- `DonutChart` is now simply `Donut`, and `DonutSlice` is `Donut.Slice`.

There is a [codemod](#codemods) available to upgrade from [2.x.x-beta](#200-beta) and updating the package name:

```
npx jscodeshift -t node_modules/@primer/components/codemods/v3.js path/to/src
```

## `2.0.0-beta`

[The 2.0.0-beta release](https://github.com/primer/react/releases/v2.0.0-beta) is a major version bump because it renames several components:

- `Box` is now `BorderBox`
- `Block` is now `Box`
- `CaretBox` is now `PointerBox`

We suggest that you rename your components in the above order, since renaming `Block` to `Box` before renaming the old `Box` component to `BorderBox` will cause problems.

There is a [codemod](#codemods) available to upgrade from [1.x.x-beta](#100-beta):

```
npx jscodeshift -t node_modules/primer-react/codemods/v2.js path/to/src
```

## `1.0.0-beta`

[This release](https://github.com/primer/react/releases/v1.0.0-beta) is a major version bump because it completely refactors the guts of all our components. Here's what you need to know:

There is a [codemod](#codemods) available to upgrade from previous versions `0.x.x-beta`:

```
npx jscodeshift -t node_modules/primer-react/codemods/v1.js path/to/src
```

### Emotion and styled-system

The big change in this release is the introduction of [emotion] and [styled-system] under the hood to speed up our migration from Primer CSS to complete style encapsulation in React. For now, you will need to continue serving up [Primer CSS] to support components that haven't yet been migrated to the new styling system. See [the README](README.md#styling) for more information.

This release also introduces early support for [theming](#theming).

### Props changes

- The `tag` prop has been renamed to `is` to match [styled-system] conventions.

- Color props will require refactoring:

  - The `fg` prop has been renamed to `color` across the board.

  - Color prop (`bg`, `color`, and `borderColor`) values are now object paths that represent nested fields in the `colors` object of our [default theme]. Because all of our [color gradations] are expressed as arrays, the `gray`, `blue`, `green`, `orange`, `purple`, `red`, and `yellow` values need to be updated to include the `.5` suffix so that they receive the value closest to the middle of each hue gradation (`red.5` maps to `theme.colors.red[5]`).

    In other words, `color="red"` becomes `color="red.5"`, `bg="purple"` becomes `bg="purple.5"`, and so on. See [the full list of changes](#color-props) below.

- [Some typography props](#typography-props) will require refactoring.

- [Some `Block` props](#block-props) have changed.

- [Some `FlexContainer` and `FlexItem` props](#flex-props) have changed.

### Theming

Theming is an optional way to override the values that control color, spacing, typography, and other aspects of our components.

There are two ways to change the theme of @primer/components components:

1. You can override the theme for an entire tree of components using the `<ThemeProvider>` from [emotion-theming]:

   ```jsx
   import {Block, Button, Text, theme as primer} from '@primer/components'
   import {ThemeProvider} from 'emotion-theming'

   // a theme with custom spacing and font sizes
   const theme = {
     ...primer,
     space: [0, 8, 16, 32, 64],
     fontSizes: [10, 12, 16, 24, 48],
   }

   // override
   theme.colors.bodytext = '#111'

   export default () => (
     <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
       <Block sx={{color: 'bodytext', p: 4}}>
         <Text fontSize={4}>Hello, world!</Text>
       </Block>
     </ThemeProvider>
   )
   ```

   **⚠️ Note: [emotion-theming]'s `<ThemeProvider>` only allows exactly one child.**

1. You can theme individual components by passing the `theme` prop directly:

   ```jsx
   import {Text} from '@primer/components'

   const theme = {
     colors: {
       magenta: '#f0f',
     },
   }

   export default () => (
     <Text theme={theme} color="magenta">
       Hi, I'm magenta!
     </Text>
   )
   ```

   **☝️ This is an intentionally convoluted example, since you can use `<Text color='#f0f'>` out of the box.**

Read the [styled-system docs](http://jxnblk.com/styled-system/getting-started#theming) for more information on theming in styled-system.

### Color props

The following table lists color prop values that have changed in `1.0.0-beta`:

| Prop          | Before         | After         | Notes            |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------ | :--------------- |

| `color`       | `purple`       | `purple.5`    |                  |
| `color`       | `red`          | `red.6`       |                  |

Remember that all `fg` props must be renamed to `color`.

### Typography props

- Typography props are still only available on the `Text` and `Heading` components.

- The `fontSize` prop works as before, but now treats any value that doesn't represent an index of `theme.fontSizes` as a literal CSS value.

- The `lineHeight` prop now accepts one of the keys from `theme.lineHeights`: `default`, `condensed`, or `condensedUltra`. Any other value will be passed along as a literal CSS value.

The following table lists typography-related prop substitutions:

| Prop         | Value(s)          | Substitute                    |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :---------------------------- |
| `lineHeight` | `condensed-ultra` | `lineHeight="condensedUltra"` |
| `mono`       | (boolean)         | `fontFamily="mono"`           |
| `nowrap`     | (boolean)         | `css="white-space: nowrap"`   |

### `Block` props

The `Block` component supports most of the same props, but the following ones will need to be refactored:

| Prop     | Value(s)   | Substitute          |
| :------- | :--------- | :------------------ |
| `border` | `true`     | `border={1}`        |
| `border` | `'bottom'` | `borderBottom={1}`  |
| `border` | `'left'`   | `borderLeft={1}`    |
| `border` | `'right'`  | `borderRight={1}`   |
| `border` | `'top'`    | `borderTop={1}`     |
| `shadow` | _all_      | `boxShadow="value"` |

Note: array values in border props represent [responsive values].

### Flex props

The `FlexContainer` and `FlexItem` components have changed significantly in this version. The following props have been renamed or deprecated:

#### `FlexContainer`

| Prop        | Value(s)         | Substitute                  |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `direction` | _all_            | `flexDirection="css-value"` |
| `wrap`      | `wrap`, `nowrap` | `flexWrap="css-value"`      |
| `inline`    | (boolean)        | `display="inline-flex"`     |

#### `FlexItem`

| Prop       | Value(s)  | Substitute          |
| :--------- | :-------- | :------------------ |
| `flexAuto` | (boolean) | No longer supported |

## Codemods

[Codemods](https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-with-codemods/) are scripted transformations that you can run on your code to relieve you of most of the grunt work involved in upgrading from one major version to the next. The codemod instructions for each major release assume that your code has already been upgraded to the **previous major release**. If this is not the case, you should run the codemods for all previous major versions first.

Beware that codemods are not 100% fool-proof and may break your code, especially if you do unexpected things like alias Primer exports in strange ways (`import {Box as box}...`), or use component identifiers from other modules that conflict with Primer's. Before running a codemod, please either back up your work or commit it, then carefully inspect the diff.
