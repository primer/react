Adds `variant` and `shape` props to `AvatarStack` component. The `variant` prop will allow the component to render in a cascade view (by default) or a new stacked view which will evenly space the avatars and remove opacity. The `shape` prop will allow the avatars to be rendered as circles (by default) or squares.
