Adds an 'inactive' state to buttons. An inactive button looks disabled and has aria-disabled, but it can still be clicked and focused. This was added to support buttons that are broken due to availability issues, but can't be removed from the page.

<!-- Changed components: Button, Button2, IconButton -->
